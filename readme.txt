1) we have to create the database in our Mysql workbench and name it Currency_Conversion
2) First of all we have to connect the database to the java maven through java - connector to be found in project lib
3) after that we have to populate the databases a function to be found in the TaskOne.java and its easy to use
4) from here we can start running our test.java for the first part and for the report mvn surfire:report:report
5) and for the selinuim i believe because i used firefox then we need to have geodcoker in the project which is already there so nothing to do just run it
6) but we need to run the server whihch is to be in another project that is pushed to my github under the name of login.
7) just go to that project and activate the django enviroment and for the last step just run the server by using the command python manage.py runserver
8) after the server is up you can start running the selinum test class .
